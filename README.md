# SoundScapes
The project contains the NetLogo source code for the model described in Toth et al. 2022. It simulates vehicle traffic, wildlife movements, and the masking effects of noise.
The initial vesion was created by Benjamin Pauli. Kurt Fristrup revised the model to add vehicles to model the movement and geometry of noise exposure more precisely.
